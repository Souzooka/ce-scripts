This repository contains Cheat Engine Assemblies (default hotkey to open script window in CE: Ctrl+Alt+A) which demonstrate accessing data which may be helpful for RetroAchievements achievement sets, but the means for which are currently impossible for current tooling.

These scripts are (for PS2 at least) written using the emurpm plugin (can be found in Cheat Engine's Github repository), and the base memory address set to [eemem], which allows just using PS2 addresses directly.
